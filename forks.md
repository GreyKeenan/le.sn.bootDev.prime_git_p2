A fork is not a git feature. It is a feature of many git hosting services, like github. A fork is just a copy of the original repository, related through metadata and convention


## general steps of forkinging

1. fork repo to your acct
1. create local clone of the forked repo
1. create a new branch for your modifications
1. make changes
1. commit changes to remote of that new branch
1. pull request to original repo from remote-new-branch
