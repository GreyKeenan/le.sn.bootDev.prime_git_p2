> second part of the course. Part one at: GreyKeenan/le.sn.bootDev.prime_git

following [this boot.dev course](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-git-2)


## Organization

The exercises for this second part are done within a fork of another repo. I plan to add a 'notes' branch to that fork which will have my notes, then to set that branch as the default on gh. Hey, you may be reading this on the 'notes' branch right now!
