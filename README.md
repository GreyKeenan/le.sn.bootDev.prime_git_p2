> second part of the course. Part one at: GreyKeenan/le.sn.bootDev.prime_git

following [this boot.dev course](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-git-2)


## Takeaways:

This second part of the course was really helpful for me. Id brushed up against most of these concepts occasionally when trying to use git, but I was always lacking a fundamental understanding of them to use them beyong just copy/pasting. This has changed things

The only things I really knew about before this were:
	- forking
	- that conflicts happen, but not really how to address them confidently
	- stashing
	- squashing, generally
	- cherry-pick, vaguely

I feel a lot more confident in my ability to navigate around a repository. Though I still need to put working-with-a-team-in-git into practice, I at least know how to start approaching it when the time comes.


## Organization

The exercises for this second part are done within a fork of another repo. I plan to add a 'notes' branch to that fork which will have my notes, then to set that branch as the default on gh. Hey, you may be reading this on the 'notes' branch right now!
